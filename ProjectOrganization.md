# Project Name #

The project name "spray" is already used for another open source project to be found at: https://github.com/spray/spray/ http://spray.cc

It might be necessary to rename the project. Some ideas here:
  * The name should stay something with "spray"
  * It might not be too generic
  * It might not reflect too direct relationship to Graphiti Runtime
  * It should have an available .org address

itemis has reserved graphiti-spray.org for the project.

Suggestions:
